              hello, I'm super excited to be taking this coding bootcamp to help further my understanding of the vast
              world within developing.I’m looking forward to getting a job as a developer after im done with this
              bootcamp. I’ll also be working on an app idea I have while completing this course.

              Not long ago I moved down to southern california, in search of better opportunities to better my life.
              It’s been a rollercoaster of ups and downs but it has been for the better. I’m currently working at a
              restaurant and being underpaid for my skills which I’m tired of doing and that's a big factor as to why I
              pulled the trigger on this bootcamp. Another big reason i chose to join is because, with coding you can
              think of an idea and with enough willpower you can create that idea and make it become a reality. Coding
              is the future and I'd like to be at the forefront of this industry. Hopefully I'll be able to have a big
              impact in the field.
